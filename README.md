I shove manifest files for android roms I build here. 

add these to .repo/local_manifests/ and resync to use them

contents:

aosp_mako: an AOSP rom for the nexus 4. once I get it how I like, I will be using it instead of CyanogenMod

dscm7: CyanogenMod7 for the G1 and Sapphire

iho_magpie: my cm7 rom for the LG Optimus V (also works on the optimus s and maybe other cdma optimus one devices)
